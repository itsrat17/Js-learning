// "use strict"; // this is used to tell the js that we are strictly using the newer features of js, such as classes, modules, arrow functions.
// // although if you dont even write use strict, it automatically knows that you are using newer version of js.
// //There is no "use no strict"

// //alert("hello") // this would give an error because this is working inside node. 
// // if this was being used in browser, it wouldnt give an error.

// // where to use space, semicolon?
// //make it readable.

// let name = "Rachit" // string
// let age = 19 // number
// let isStudent = true // boolean
// let address = null // null
// let phoneNumber // undefined
// let uniqueID = Symbol("12345") // symbol => Uniqueness


// //null is a standalone value in javascript, it is not an object. It represents the intentional absence of any object value.
// // undefined is basically that the value is not assigned yet.
// //symbol is a UNIQUE and immutable primitive value and may be used as the key of an Object property.

// console.log(typeof name);
// console.log(typeof address). //object
